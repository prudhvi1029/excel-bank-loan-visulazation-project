# Excel-Bank-Loan-Visulazation-Project

**Project Overview**

This repository contains an Excel project focused on visualizing data related to a bank's lending activities. The goal of this project is to provide insights into key loan-related metrics, track changes over time, and facilitate data-driven decision-making. The project includes various types of visualizations created using Excel's built-in tools.

**Contents**

Excel File: Bank_Loan_Report.xlsx
Contains raw data and multiple sheets with different types of visualizations.
Each sheet is dedicated to specific visualizations for summary, overview, and detailed insights.
Project Details

**#Data Sheet**

Source: The raw data used for visualization was sourced from a Kaggle dataset in CSV format.

Processing:

The data was opened in Excel, copied, and saved as a separate Excel file.
Data cleaning steps included removing empty rows, finding and removing duplicates, and checking and correcting number formatting.
The cleaned data was then used for analysis and visualization.

**#Design Sheet**

Purpose: Contains all the necessary pivot tables and graphs for visualization used in both the summary and overview dashboards.

**#Dashboard 1: Summary**

To monitor and assess the bank's lending activities and performance, the Summary Dashboard provides insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. This dashboard includes:

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

1.Total Loan Applications:

Total number of loan applications received.
Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications.
Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

    Insight: A consistent increase in loan applications over the past few months indicates growing demand for loans. 
    Spikes in applications could correlate with specific times of the year or external economic factors.

2.Total Funded Amount:

Total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
MTD Total Funded Amount.
MoM changes in funded amounts.

    Insight: If the total funded amount is rising in line with applications, 
    it suggests the bank is successfully converting applications into disbursed loans. 
    Discrepancies between applications and funded amounts might indicate approval challenges or stricter lending criteria.

3.Total Amount Received:

Total amount received from borrowers.
MTD Total Amount Received.
MoM changes in received amounts.

    Insight: A steady or increasing total amount received indicates healthy loan repayments and cash flow. 
    Drops in this metric could signal repayment issues or economic stress affecting borrowers.

4.Average Interest Rate:

Average interest rate across all loans.
MTD Average Interest Rate.
MoM variations in interest rates.

    Insight: Fluctuations in the average interest rate can reflect changes in monetary policy, 
    risk assessment practices, or competitive pressures in the lending market.

5.Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):

Average DTI for borrowers.
MTD Average DTI.
MoM fluctuations in DTI.

    Insight: A higher average DTI might indicate that borrowers are taking on more debt relative to their income, 
    which could increase default risk. Monitoring this ratio helps in adjusting lending strategies to maintain portfolio health.

**Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:**

1.Good Loans:

Percentage and number of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans' (Fully Paid and Current).
Total funded amount and total received amount for 'Good Loans.'

    Insight: A high percentage of good loans (Fully Paid and Current) suggests strong credit underwriting standards 
    and effective borrower screening processes. 
    Trends in this metric can highlight the effectiveness of the bank's risk management.

2.Bad Loans:

Percentage and number of loan applications classified as 'Bad Loans' (Charged Off).
Total funded amount and total received amount for 'Bad Loans.'

    Insight: An increase in bad loans (Charged Off) signals potential issues in borrower repayment capabilities 
    and may necessitate a review of credit policies or economic factors impacting borrowers.

**#Dashboard 2: Overview**

The Overview Dashboard uses various chart types to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends.

**Chart Types and Objectives:**

1.Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):

Visualizes trends in total loan applications, funded amounts, and received amounts over time.

    Insight: Identifying trends and seasonality in loan applications, funded amounts, 
    and amounts received can help predict future lending needs and cash flow. 
    For example, higher loan applications during certain months might indicate seasonal borrowing patterns.

2.Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):

Shows lending metrics categorized by state to identify regional disparities.

    Insight: Regional disparities in lending metrics can highlight areas with higher or lower loan activity, 
    helping to target marketing efforts or adjust regional lending strategies. 
    For example, states with lower funded amounts might benefit from targeted financial products or outreach.

3.Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):

Illustrates lending metrics distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths.

    Insight: Examining how lending metrics vary by employment length can reveal t
    he impact of job stability on loan approvals and repayments. 
    Borrowers with longer employment histories might present lower default risks.

4.Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):

Depicts loan statistics based on different loan terms.

    Insight: Understanding the distribution of loans across different term lengths 
    helps in assessing borrower preferences and risk profiles. 
    A predominance of longer-term loans might indicate borrower confidence in long-term financial stability.

5.Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):

Provides a breakdown of loan metrics based on loan purposes.

    Insight: Insights into the primary reasons for borrowing can guide product development 
    and marketing strategies. For example, 
    a high number of loans for debt consolidation might indicate economic stress or high existing debt levels among borrowers.

6.Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):

Displays loan metrics categorized by home ownership status.

    Insight: Analyzing loan metrics by home ownership status can reveal differences in borrowing behavior and risk. 
    Homeowners might represent a lower credit risk compared to renters, influencing lending policies.
